#Window Creation

![Preview Image](https://github.com/tocchan/guildhall_samples/blob/master/images/d3d11_setup.png "Example Image")

##Setup
__Requires Windows 10 SDK if you want to create a Debug Context!!!__

Builds off of [window/create](https://github.com/tocchan/guildhall_samples/tree/master/window/create) to setup a debug D3D11 Instance.


##Project Property Chagnes;
- "General -> Project Defaults -> CharacterSet" was changed to "Use Multi-Byte Character Set"


##Notes
- I have a hardcoded "Destroy this window when Escape is pressed" inside the windows proc.  Remove this after cleanup.
